# DestinyMusicViewer

## How to install and use
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/nblockbuster/DestinyMusicViewer/releases/latest) of the tool.
- Download [.NET Desktop Runtime 6.0 x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.6-windows-x64-installer) (you might already have this)
- Once it opens, select your Destiny 2/packages/ directory (only The Witch Queen and up packages work)
- It'll freeze for a bit, and will do this every time it opens (I'm trying to work on a solution to this!)
- It should fill the left bar with all the music files
- Exporting can be done by clicking Export Selected for exporting the selected music file/segment.
- Clicking on any music file will bring up the segments it's used in on the right bar.
- - Clicking on the segments will play all of the music inside the segment at the same time.
- - You can also export the segments by clicking Export Selected or Export All In List
